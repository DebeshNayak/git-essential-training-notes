Deleting a remote branch:
git branch -a
// display local as well as remote branch

git push origin :non_tracking
// old way to removing remote branch

// why this non-intutive way of removing remote branch
// when we push the branch to remote repository we have done as follows:
git push origin non_tracking
// but in the background it done like the following
git push origin non_tracking:non_tracking

git push origin --delete non_tracking
// new way to delete git remote branch
