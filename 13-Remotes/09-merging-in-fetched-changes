Merging in fetched changes:
* While fetching from git using "git fetch", it gets all the new changes to "origin/master" branch not to the "master" local branch.
  All it did was, origin/master in sync.

* To get the new changes that we got from "git fetch" command we have to merge the updated "origin/master" branch with "master" branch.

git branch -a

git diff origin/master..master

git merge origin/master

git log --oneline -3 master

git pull = git fetch + git merge
