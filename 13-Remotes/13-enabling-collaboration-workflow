Enables collaboration:

To enable collaboration do the following steps:
(Private Project)
1. Go to the project home page, then click on "Setting"
2. Then open the "Collaborators" tab. Then enter the GitHub Username of the user you want to collaborate with.
3. After adding them to the project, GitHub will send the user an email and tell them that they have added into that repository.
  and provide the GitHub URL and so that they can clone it and start working on it.

(Public project)
1. Fork the project, so that it will create a own version of the repository on your GitHub dashboard.
2. Then make the changes
3. Add your changes to the main repository, apply a "New pull request" (I have something that I wanted to show  you.)
4. In the "Pull request" comment section,
    0. What problem you saw?
    1. What new changes/feature you wanted to make?
    2. How you wanted to do it?
    3. Why you think it's good for project?
