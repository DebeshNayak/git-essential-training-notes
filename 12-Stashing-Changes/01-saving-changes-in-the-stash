Saving changes in the stash:

What is a Stash?
Ans: The stash is a place where we can store changes temporarily without having to commit them to the repository. It's a lot like putting something into a drawer to save it for later. The stash is not part of the repository, the staging index or the working directory, it's a special fourth area in Git, separate from the others. And the things that we put into it aren't commits, but they're a lot like commits, they work in a very similar way. They're still a snapshot of the changes that we were in the process of making, just like a commit is. But they don't have a SHA associated with them.

git checkout shorten_title

* then

git stash save "changed mission page title"

(after stashing the changes git ran "git reset --hard", so it replaced whatever are there in the repository with working directory, and staging index area)
