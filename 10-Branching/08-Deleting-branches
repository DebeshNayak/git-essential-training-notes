git checkout master

git branch branch_to_delete
// create a new branch to delete
git branch -d branch_to_delete
// we have not swiched to the new branch and going to delete it
git branch --delete branch_to_delete
// another way to delete a branch
1. Make sure switch off from that branch

2. If there is some changes in the new branch then git would not let you delete the branch, in that case use the following:

git branch -D branch_to_delete
