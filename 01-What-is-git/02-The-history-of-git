Git is born
* April 2005
* created by Linus Torvalds
* replacement for BitKeeper to manage Linux kernel source code
* distributed version control
* open source and free software
* compatible with Unix-like systems (Linux, Mac OS X, and Solaris) and Windows
* faster then other SCMs (100x in some cases)
* better safeguards against data corruption

Git is a hit
  * explosion in popularity
  * no official statistics
  * GitHub launched in 2008 to host Git repositories
    - 2009: over 50,000 repositories, over 100,000 users
