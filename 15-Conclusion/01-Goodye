Using the Git can revolutionize the way you code.

* More confidence to make big changes as knowing that your old versions are only just a few keystrokes away.
* You'll feel empowered to try new ideas and code branches without worrying that you might break the main project.
* You'll be able to collaborate effectively with other Git users, whether it's your own project,
  on a company or client project or any open source project.
* Git changes the way you code in less obvious ways:
  - Your changes will become smaller and more focused.
