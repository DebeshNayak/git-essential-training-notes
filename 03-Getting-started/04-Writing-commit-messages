Writing commit messages:

* commit message best practices:
  - short single-line summary (less than 50 characters)
  - optionally followed by a blank line and a more complete description
  - keep each line to less than 72 characters
  - write commit messages in present tense, no past tense
    - "fix bug" or "fixes but" not "fixed bug"
  - bullet points are usually asterisks or hypens
  - can add "ticket tracking numbers" from bugs or support requests
  - can develop shorthand for your organization
    - "[css, js]"
    - "bugfix: "
    - "#38405 - "
  - Be clear and descriptive
    - Bad: "Fix typo"
    - Good: "Add missing > in project section of HTML"
    - Bad: "Update login code"
    - Good: "Change user authentication to use Blowfish"
  - Bad: "Updates member report, we should discuss if this is right next week"

Example of a commit messages:

t23094 - Fixes bug in admin logout

When an admin logged out of the admin area, they
could not login to the members area because their
session[:user_id] was still set to the admin ID. This patch
fixes the bug by setting session[:user_id] to nil when
any user logs out of any area.
