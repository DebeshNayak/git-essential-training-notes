Resolving merge conflicts:

Merge conflict could be resolved in either of the following 3 ways:

1. abort merge

git merge --abort

2. resolve the conflicts manually

1. Open the file with the conflicts:
2. Find the spot with the merge. (<<<<<<< HEAD , ======= , >>>>>>> text_edits )
3. Fix the text inside the (========) and (>>>>>>>>> text_edits) section.
4. Then remove the text between (<<<<<<<< HEAD) and (===========) and remove the symbols also
5. Do "git status"
6. Then add the file to the staging index by "git add <file name>"
7. Then "git commit"
6. Then it will automatically open the text editor, here write the commit message
7. Then "save" and "exit" the browser.

git log --graph --oneline --all --decorate

3. Use a merge tool

git mergetool --tool=<name of the tool that you want>

git help mergetools
